# PolynomialSummations

* This project aims to do Polynomial Summations and visualizing them inside the cmd/console using C. The project is liscensed under MIT Liscense and can be used in basically everywhere with giving credits. (I don't care that much if you give credit or no. But I'd appreciate it if you do.)
* The code might be a bit messy and unoptimized. Keep it in mind that I worte it all in 2 hours and I don't usually code in C. Please hit me up if you wanna update the code with your own additions.


Goodluck!
